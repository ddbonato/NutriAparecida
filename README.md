# NutryAparecida

A website created for the purpose of learning, imagining a page used by a nutritionist, with the goal of acquiring knowledge and experience in front-end development.

The project's primary focus is the use of JavaScript to modify and shape HTML and CSS, resulting in a dynamic page with various features, 
including filtering, adding elements, and validating information, all within the front-end scope.

On the website, itÂ´s possible to add and remove patients, automatically calculating their BMI.
